 and length of type double.
 The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length of type double and it
 needs to initialize the fields.
 In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, in case the length
 parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.
 Write the following methods (instance methods):
 ‚óè Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area
 (width * length).**/
